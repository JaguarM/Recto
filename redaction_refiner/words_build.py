"""Build static/redaction_refiner/words.txt — the refiner's English word list.

    python redaction_refiner/words_build.py

One lowercase word per line, most frequent first. It is the intersection of

  * google-10000-english (20k variant) — Google Trillion Word Corpus n-gram
    frequencies, which gives the ORDER (the refiner ranks fragment completions
    by it: "nd" → "and" before "end", "find", …), and
  * SCOWL / ESDB size 60 (app.aspell.net/create, US + GB spellings) — a
    screened dictionary, which gives VALIDITY and drops the web junk the
    n-gram list carries ("www", "xxx", "pdf", …). Only its lowercase entries
    count: capitalised ones are proper nouns and uppercase ones abbreviations
    ("ND"), and either would smuggle junk like "nd" back in.

Single letters are dropped except the words "a" and "i". Re-run to refresh;
the output is committed so the app needs no network and no Python package.
